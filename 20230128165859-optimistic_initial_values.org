#+title: Optimistic Initial Values
#+filetags: :machine-learning:reinforcement-learning:probability:

* Definition
Initialize $Q_1$ as being larger than the hand-made estimate of what rewards actually look like.

* Benefits
Optimistic initial values encourage exploration early on and latter on focus on exploitation.

* Limitations
Optimistic initial values *only* drive early exploration, it will eventually stop exploring, making them non-suitable for [[id:a5b7fede-d900-47d8-b841-74ce0d6588a5][Non-Stationary Problems]].
We may not always know what a proper optimistic initial value of $Q_1$ is.
