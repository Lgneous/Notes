The concept of assigning a reward to an action by estimating the long term benefits.

Example:
In football, there will be many different actions, passes, dribbles, shots, etc.
Estimating which were good or bad actions and which ones contributed the most to scoring a goal or, in the opposite situation, losing the ball and getting a goal scored against the team is named the Temporal Credit Assignment problem.
