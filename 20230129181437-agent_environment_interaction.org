#+title: Agent-Environment Interaction
#+filetags: :reinforcement-learning:markov:

The agent interacts with the environment responding to its actions and presenting new states to the agent.

The environment also gives rise to rewards, numerical values that the agent tries to maximize over time through the choice of actions.

Repeatedly:
- The agent receives a reward $R_t$ and a state $S_t$. 
- The agent takes an action $A_t$ given the state $S_t$.
- The environment sends a reward $R_{t+1}$ and a new state $S_{t+1}$.

Specifically, the agent and environment interact at each step of a sequence of discrete time step, $\text{t=0,1,2,3,...}$.
At each time step $t$, the agent receives some representation of the environment's state $S_t \in \bold{S}$, and selects an action $A_t \in \bold{A}$.
One step later, it receives a numerical reward $R_{t+1} \in \bold{R} \in \mathbb{R}$ and enters a new state $S_{t+1}$.
