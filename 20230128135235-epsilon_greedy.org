#+title: Epsilon-Greedy
#+filetags: :reinforcement-learning:machine-learning:probability:

The approach that consists of using a random action chosen uniformly from all the available actions with probability $\epsilon$.
Otherwise, it picks one of the greedy actions. 

\begin{aligned}
A_t = 
\left\{
    \begin{array}{lr}
        \underset{a}{\text{argmax}}\;Q_t(a)\hfill\;{with\;probability\;(1 - \epsilon)} \\
        a\;{\sim}\;Uniform(\{a_1, ..., a_k\})\hfill\;{with\;probability\;\epsilon}
    \end{array}
\right\}
\end{aligned}

Generally speaking, the higher the $\epsilon$, the earlier the reward will plateau, but it will initially grow much faster.
